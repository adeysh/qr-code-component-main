## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- I tried to use relative units such as `rem` instead of fixed units like `px` in my css.
- Also tried to modularize my code for different purposes. Although it's a small project challenge, it has made me familiar with the use of css modules.
